# GinYa Application 💊

Application that would track and notify patients to take the correct medication at the prescribed amount and designated time. The patient’s intake of medication would be recorded and a report would be generated. This report would then aid doctors to accurately diagnose the patient and their recovery before providing the patient with a new medical prescription.

## Installation 📲

To run the application, we used android studio because of the various features it provided that helped develop the application. All one needs to do to setup the project on their own device is:

1. ```bash git clone``` the Github repository onto their Android Studio

2. ```bash git clone https://github.com/6222790345/GinYa.git```

3. Install all the dependencies listed in Package.json using ```bash npm i```

4. Setup a virtual android device (Pixel 5 and Android 11 worked best for us)

5. Run  the following code in cmd to start the application ```bash npx react-native run-android```

6. Wait for node.js to bundle the entire application and start it on the virtual device

7. Login/Signup to GinYa
